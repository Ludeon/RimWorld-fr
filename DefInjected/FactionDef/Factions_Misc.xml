Maybe they survived some cataclysm that destroyed a technological civilization here.

They are quite open to trade and alliances, even with strange peoples.</TribeCivil.description>

  <Pirate.description>Un groupe de bandits.\n\nIls ne s'implantent pas, ne construisent pas et commercent rarement. Ils s'enrichissent principalement par les raids et le pillage de communautés plus productives.\n\nLeurs technologies dépendent principalement des groupes qu'ils ont eut l'occasion d'attaquer. La plupart sont donc équipés d'armes à feu, mais certains chanceux ont des armes plus avancées, quand d'autres doivent se contenter de poignarder leurs victimes au corps-à-corps.</Pirate.description>
